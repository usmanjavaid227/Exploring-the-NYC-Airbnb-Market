# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

Welcome to the NYC Airbnb Data Analysis project! In this project, we explore and analyze the Airbnb market in New York City by importing, cleaning, and analyzing data from multiple file types.

## Project Description

New York City (NYC) is one of the most-visited cities globally, leading to a high demand for temporary lodging. Airbnb listings cater to this demand, offering accommodations ranging from single private rooms to entire apartments or homes. In this project, we aim to uncover insights about the NYC Airbnb market by answering key questions, such as:

- What is the average price per night of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing compare to the private rental market?
- How many listings are for private rooms versus entire homes/apartments?
- How do Airbnb listing prices vary across the five NYC boroughs?

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Formats**: CSV, Excel (XLSX), Tab-separated values (TSV)
- **Data Cleaning Techniques**: String manipulation, Date manipulation
